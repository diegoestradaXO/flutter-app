# Task App: An Internationalized Flutter App
This is an app for creating and deleting tasks. You can write a title and description for each task. The app can handle internationalization, that means it supports many languages (only English and Spanish in this case) as long as you add the translations in the code. It can recognize your system language or you can manually select any language available. Task App also saves your preferences in the local storage, this means that you can close the app and when relaunched, the language and theme mode will be the same as last session. For creating and deleting tasks sqflite is used. If you want to check out the packages used in this project, go to the pubspec.yaml file and search for dependencies.
